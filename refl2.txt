When you initialize a repository, git takes inventory of that directory. Notes the files avaiable to be tracked, and creates the record of files that are in and out of tracking. Without this step, there would be not .git file and no files would be tracked. The directory would not be a respository. 
The staging area differs from the working directory in that it is a list that is a subset of the working directory. The working directory is all the files. The staging area is those files that are pending commit. The repository is all those files in the working directory that are being tracked, plus their histories.
The value of the staging area is to give you control over what is included in one commit. By including only part of the file collection you can limit commits to logical chunks.
