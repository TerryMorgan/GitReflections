You can have on your remote repo only those changes you are wanting to share.
Think of this like the stable branch, the shared branch is the portion of the project that you make public on GitHub.

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you are working with others on the same project.
When you are wanting a remote backup, though this is not private. 
You could push your whole repo to your own remote (for backup) and push the shared branch to the shared project repo (for collaborating).
